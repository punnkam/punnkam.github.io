## Hey! 👋 I'm Punn 

I'm an aspiring software engineer (currently CS @ UC San Diego), economics enthusiast, professional minimalist, and crypto bro(ke). 

You'll often find me either hacking passion projects, researching defi/crypto, reading YC articles, or fantasizing about scaling my theoretical startup 100x in two years. 

Outside of work I like to 💻 [blog](/blog.html), 📚 read, 🏂 snowboard, 🥊 box/gym, and watch 🏎 F1.
