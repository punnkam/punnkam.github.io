## Hey! 👋 I'm Punn 

I'm a software engineer (currently CS @ UC San Diego) interested in startups, economics, crypto, and minimalism. 

You'll often find me either hacking projects, researching defi/crypto, reading YC articles, or fantasizing about scaling my theoretical startup 100x in two years. 

I also enjoy 💻 [writing](/blog.html), 📚 reading, 🏂 snowboarding, 🥊 boxing/gym, and watching 🏎 F1.
