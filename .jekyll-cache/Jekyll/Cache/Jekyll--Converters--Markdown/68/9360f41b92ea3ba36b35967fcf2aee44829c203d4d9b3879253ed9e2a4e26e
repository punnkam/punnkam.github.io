<p>I’m a software engineer (currently CS @ UC San Diego), economics enthusiast, professional minimalist, and crypto bro(ke).</p>

<p>You’ll often find me either hacking projects, researching defi/crypto, reading YC articles, or fantasizing about scaling my theoretical startup 100x in two years.</p>

<p>I also enjoy 💻 <a href="/blog.html">writing</a>, 📚 reading, 🏂 snowboarding, 🥊 boxing/gym, and watching 🏎 F1.</p>
