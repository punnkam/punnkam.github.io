<p>DeFi is approaching its pre-teen years and has enjoyed an amazing year outperforming the crypto market as a whole. This outperformance is measured in each protocol’s token, some of which generate cash flow (dividends) for token holders while others do not. For protocols returning value back to tokenholders, the process of performing valuations is straightforward and similar to dividend stocks. However, for “valueless” governance tokens, cash flow models are generally inappropriate.</p>

<p>Currently, cryptoassets including DeFi have a high beta against Ethereum and the decoupling of asset prices have only been temporarily observed. Since there are proportionately more “valueless” governance tokens, the performance of these protocols have arguably more effect on the overall DeFi ecosystem than those generating cash flow. Thus, investors must find appropriate models to value these new assets, which traditional models struggle to make sense of.</p>

<p>In this post, I will share my process of valuing DeFi protocols liquidly trading on the open market. This is the process I follow for valuing all DeFi tokens, regardless of when it accrues value back to token holders. DeFi is it’s own asset class within crypto, and the valuation must be performed on relative terms if we are aiming for the best returns in the market.</p>

<p>Take my analysis with a grain of salt and apply your own style/analysis.</p>

<p>Five step valuation process:</p>

<p>   I. <strong>Financials</strong>
  II. <strong>Fundamentals</strong>
  III. <strong>Market</strong>
  IV. <strong>Community</strong>
  V. <strong>Intangibles</strong></p>

<h2 id="financials">Financials</h2>
<p>The first step of valuation is the financial valuation. The process is most familiar to methods of valuation in traditional finance. While it is natural to place the great importance on financial valuations in tradfi, the lack of consensus in the use of valuation models means we should not be too strict on using these models to screen investments. We will use Comparable Companies Analysis (comps), a valuation model that compares financial ratios/metrics across comparable protocols. This approach is the most common in crypto firms.</p>

<p>As an example to help illustrate this step, we will be performing a financial valuation on Sushiswap.</p>

<p>Performing a comps analysis paints SUSHI as relatively undervalued compared to other DEXes. However, some ratios are incorrectly inflated from using fully diluted market cap (FDMC) in the calculations instead of circulating market cap (CMC). In many cases where vesting schedules are spread over 5-10 years, FDMC is an inaccurate representation of a protocol’s valuation (potential outcomes for valuation increase exponentially with time); therefore, we will use CMC as well.</p>

<p>    <em>Data Extracted from tokenterminal.com, coingecko.com, and duneanalytics.com</em></p>

<p>Calculating ratios using CMC indicates that SUSHI is more undervalued on most metrics but also not grossly mispriced. It’s in the middle of the pack in two of the three ratios.</p>

<p>The comps analysis indicates that SUSHI is relatively undervalued on a financial basis. However, comps alone do not explain why some ratios deviate far from the rest: Uniswap’s MC/TVL, Curve’s MC/7D VOL, and 0x’s P/S. For example, Uniswap’s low TVL is because the protocol doesn’t support staking rewards for UNI tokens.</p>

<p>The comps analyses poses a few problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data used to calculate the ratios are backward looking. At best, it reflects the present. Metrics can change quickly and the path dependent outcome is all that matters, not the journey.</li>
  <li>Future functionality of the protocol is not accounted for. Features that may significantly increase TVL and Volume are not considered in the model and could drastically change the model in the future. Different value accrual mechanisms (fees, algo burns) potentially affect future metrics.</li>
  <li>Different business models hinder the comparability of each protocol. For instance, Uniswap is solely focused on creating a capital efficient AMM while Sushiswap is aiming to create a suite of DeFi products.</li>
</ul>
