I"<h2 id="hey--im-punn">Hey! ğŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Punn</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer (currently CS @ UC San Diego), economics enthusiast, professional minimalist, and crypto bro(ke).</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll often find me either hacking passion projects, researching defi/crypto, reading YC articles, or fantasizing about scaling my theoretical startup 100x in two years. Outside of work I like rugby, snowsports, boxing, and F1.</p>
