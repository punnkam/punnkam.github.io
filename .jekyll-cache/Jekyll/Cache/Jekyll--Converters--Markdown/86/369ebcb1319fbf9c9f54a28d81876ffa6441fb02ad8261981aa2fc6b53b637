<p>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒDeFi is approaching its pre-teen years and has enjoyed an amazing year outperforming the crypto market as a whole. This outperformance is measured in each protocolâ€™s token, some of which generate cash flow (dividends) for token holders while others do not. For protocols returning value back to tokenholders, the process of performing valuations is straightforward and similar to dividend stocks. However, for â€œvaluelessâ€ governance tokens, cash flow models are generally inappropriate.</p>

<p>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒCurrently, cryptoassets including DeFi have a high beta against Ethereum and the decoupling of asset prices have only been temporarily observed. Since there are proportionately more â€œvaluelessâ€ governance tokens, the performance of these protocols have arguably more effect on the overall DeFi ecosystem than those generating cash flow. Thus, investors must find appropriate models to value these new assets, which traditional models struggle to make sense of.</p>

<p>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒIn this post, I will share my process of valuing DeFi protocols liquidly trading on the open market. This is the process I follow for valuing all DeFi tokens, regardless of when it accrues value back to token holders. DeFi is itâ€™s own asset class within crypto, and the valuation must be performed on relative terms if we are aiming for the best returns in the market.</p>

<p>Take my analysis with a grain of salt and apply your own style/analysis.</p>

<p>Five step valuation process:</p>

<p>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒI. <strong>Financials</strong>
â€ƒâ€ƒII. <strong>Fundamentals</strong>
â€ƒâ€ƒIII. <strong>Market</strong>
â€ƒâ€ƒIV. <strong>Community</strong>
â€ƒâ€ƒV. <strong>Intangibles</strong></p>

<h2 id="financials">Financials</h2>
<p>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒThe first step of valuation is the financial valuation. The process is most familiar to methods of valuation in traditional finance. While it is natural to place the great importance on financial valuations in tradfi, the lack of consensus in the use of valuation models means we should not be too strict on using these models to screen investments. We will use Comparable Companies Analysis (comps), a valuation model that compares financial ratios/metrics across comparable protocols. This approach is the most common in crypto firms.</p>

<p>As an example to help illustrate this step, we will be performing a financial valuation on Sushiswap.</p>
